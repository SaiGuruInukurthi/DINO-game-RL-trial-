DINO RL PROJECT - CHANGE LOG & DECISIONS
=========================================

Date: October 19, 2025

PROJECT DECISIONS & SETUP:
--------------------------

1. Python Version: 3.14 (latest version)
   - Using conda environment named "DINO"

2. Framework Choices:
   - Deep Learning: TensorFlow (instead of PyTorch)
   - Game Engine: Pygame
   - RL Environment: Gym

3. Project Structure:
   - Model implementation: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file)
   - Code organization: Guided implementation approach

4. Version Control:
   - Git repository initialized
   - Remote: https://github.com/SaiGuruInukurthi/DINO-game-RL-trial-
   - README.md created

5. Development Environment:
   - Conda environment: DINO
   - Primary dependencies: pygame, gym, tensorflow

6. Project Implementation Structure (October 19, 2025):
   - Decision: Separate notebooks for environment and model
   - Rationale: Better organization, easier debugging and iteration
   - Implementation order: Environment first (using Pygame), then model
   - Files to create:
     * dino_environment.ipynb - Game environment with Gym interface
     * dino_model.ipynb - DQN model training (to be created later)

 
7. Code movement (October 19, 2025):
   - Action: Extracted the game implementation from `dino_environment.ipynb` into a
     standalone Python module at `src/dino_game.py` to improve reusability and allow
     the training notebook to import the environment logic.
   - Rationale: A .py module is easier to test, import, and version-control than code
     embedded inside a notebook. Manual play mode and observation/step APIs are included.

8. Dependencies update (October 19, 2025):
   - Action: Switched from deprecated `gym` to `gymnasium` (the maintained replacement)
   - Reason: gym has been unmaintained since 2022 and doesn't support NumPy 2.0
   - Installation: `pip install gymnasium` in DINO conda environment
   - Code changes: `import gym` â†’ `import gymnasium as gym`

9. WSL/Headless compatibility fix (October 19, 2025):
   - Issue: Kernel was crashing due to Pygame trying to initialize OpenGL/X11 in WSL
   - Solution: Set SDL_VIDEODRIVER='dummy' when no DISPLAY is available
   - Location: Added to both src/dino_game.py and notebook imports
   - Effect: Prevents kernel crashes in notebook environments without X server

10. Platform Switch (October 19, 2025):
   - Decision: Switching from WSL to native Windows for development
   - Reason: WSL kernel crashes with Pygame visualization, better to develop/test on Windows
   - Impact: Will be able to see game window and test manual controls properly
   - Note: The SDL_VIDEODRIVER fix remains in code for future headless/server deployment

11. Pygame Installation Fix (October 19, 2025):
   - Issue: pygame wouldn't install on Python 3.14 (setuptools error)
   - Solution: Switched to pygame-ce (pygame community edition)
   - Action: Installed pygame-ce in DINO conda environment
   - Code changes: Updated imports from `import pygame` to `import pygame_ce as pygame`
   - Files modified: src/dino_game.py, dino_environment.ipynb

12. Environment Configuration (October 19, 2025):
   - Configured notebook kernel to use DINO conda environment
   - Set workspace Python interpreter to DINO environment
   - Path: C:\Users\IC1807\anaconda3\envs\DINO\python.exe
   - All dependencies confirmed installed: pygame-ce, gymnasium, numpy

13. Environment Testing & Validation (October 19, 2025):
   - Added comprehensive test cells to dino_environment.ipynb
   - Tests include: space validation, reset function, action testing, random agent
   - Added visual testing cells for manual play and observation
   - Environment complete and ready for DQN model development
