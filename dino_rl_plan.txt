DINOSAUR GAME REINFORCEMENT LEARNING PROJECT - PLAN OF ACTION
================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Build a reinforcement learning agent that learns to play a dinosaur running game
(similar to Chrome's offline dinosaur game) using deep learning techniques.

PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP & ENVIRONMENT
-------------------------------------
1. Set up project structure with proper directories:
   - src/ (source code)
   - configs/ (configuration files)
   - data/ (training data and logs)
   - checkpoints/ (saved models)
   - logs/ (training logs and metrics)

2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
   - Python 3.8+
   - TensorFlow or PyTorch (deep learning framework)
   - Gym/Gymnasium (RL environment interface)
   - Pygame (game rendering)
   - NumPy, Matplotlib (data processing and visualization)
   - TensorBoard (training monitoring)

3. Set up version control (Git) and project documentation

PHASE 2: GAME ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT
--------------------------------------
4. Create the Dinosaur Game Environment:
   - Implement game mechanics (jumping, ducking, running)
   - Add obstacles (cacti, birds)
   - Implement collision detection
   - Add scoring system
   - Make it compatible with OpenAI Gym interface

5. Define observation space:
   - Distance to next obstacle
   - Obstacle type and height
   - Dinosaur velocity
   - Game speed
   - Optional: Raw pixel data for CNN-based approach

6. Define action space:
   - Action 0: Do nothing (run)
   - Action 1: Jump
   - Action 2: Duck (optional)

7. Define reward function:
   - +0.1 for each frame survived
   - +10 for successfully passing an obstacle
   - -100 for collision (game over)
   - Bonus for achieving high scores

PHASE 3: RL AGENT ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------------
8. Choose RL algorithm:
   - Option A: Deep Q-Network (DQN) - recommended for beginners
   - Option B: Double DQN (improved stability)
   - Option C: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
   - Option D: A3C (Asynchronous Actor-Critic)

9. Design neural network architecture:
   For state-based input:
   - Input layer: state features (5-10 dimensions)
   - Hidden layers: 2-3 fully connected layers (128-256 neurons)
   - Output layer: Q-values for each action
   
   For image-based input:
   - Convolutional layers for feature extraction
   - Fully connected layers for decision making
   - Output layer: Q-values for each action

10. Implement experience replay buffer:
    - Store transitions (state, action, reward, next_state, done)
    - Sample random mini-batches for training
    - Capacity: 10,000 - 100,000 experiences

PHASE 4: TRAINING INFRASTRUCTURE
---------------------------------
11. Implement training loop:
    - Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
    - Target network for stable learning
    - Batch training with mini-batches
    - Periodic model checkpointing

12. Set hyperparameters:
    - Learning rate: 0.001 - 0.0001
    - Discount factor (gamma): 0.95 - 0.99
    - Epsilon decay: Start 1.0, end 0.01
    - Batch size: 32 - 128
    - Target network update frequency: every 1000 steps
    - Training episodes: 1000 - 5000

13. Implement logging and monitoring:
    - Track average reward per episode
    - Track max score achieved
    - Track loss values
    - Track epsilon decay
    - Save training curves

PHASE 5: TRAINING & OPTIMIZATION
---------------------------------
14. Train the initial model:
    - Run for 500-1000 episodes
    - Monitor convergence
    - Adjust hyperparameters as needed

15. Evaluate agent performance:
    - Test on multiple episodes without exploration
    - Calculate average score
    - Visualize gameplay

16. Optimize and tune:
    - Adjust reward function if needed
    - Try different network architectures
    - Experiment with hyperparameters
    - Implement curriculum learning (start slow, increase difficulty)

17. Handle common issues:
    - If not learning: increase exploration, adjust learning rate
    - If unstable: reduce learning rate, increase target update frequency
    - If too slow: parallelize training, use GPU acceleration

PHASE 6: ADVANCED IMPROVEMENTS (OPTIONAL)
------------------------------------------
18. Implement advanced techniques:
    - Prioritized Experience Replay
    - Dueling DQN architecture
    - Rainbow DQN (combines multiple improvements)
    - Curiosity-driven exploration

19. Add features:
    - Different difficulty levels
    - Dynamic obstacle generation
    - Day/night cycles
    - Power-ups

20. Create visualization tools:
    - Real-time gameplay visualization
    - Training progress dashboard
    - Attention maps (what agent focuses on)

PHASE 7: DEPLOYMENT & DOCUMENTATION
------------------------------------
21. Create demo/inference mode:
    - Load best model
    - Play game automatically
    - Record videos of gameplay

22. Write comprehensive documentation:
    - README with project overview
    - Installation instructions
    - Training guide
    - Results and analysis
    - Future improvements

23. Package the project:
    - Clean up code
    - Add comments and docstrings
    - Create requirements.txt
    - Add examples and tutorials

RECOMMENDED TIMELINE:
--------------------
Week 1: Project setup + Game environment (Steps 1-7)
Week 2: RL agent architecture + Training infrastructure (Steps 8-13)
Week 3: Training + Initial optimization (Steps 14-17)
Week 4: Advanced improvements + Documentation (Steps 18-23)

KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS:
------------------------
1. State representation: Feature-based vs Image-based
   Recommendation: Start with features (faster training)

2. RL Algorithm: DQN vs PPO
   Recommendation: DQN for discrete actions, easier to implement

3. Framework: TensorFlow vs PyTorch
   Recommendation: PyTorch (more intuitive, better for research)

4. Game framework: Custom vs Pygame vs Unity ML-Agents
   Recommendation: Pygame (good balance of control and simplicity)

- Achieves score > 500 points
- Successfully learns to avoid multiple obstacle types
- Training converges within 2000 episodes
- Model can generalize to varying game speeds

NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS:
---------------------
